\title{Pinniped age calculation}
\usage{
pinniped_age(event.date, cohort)
}
\arguments{
\item{event.date}{object of class \code{Date}; the date at which you wish to determine the pinniped's age}

\item{cohort}{object interpretable as number(s),
meaning \code{\link[base:numeric]{is.numeric}(cohort)} must be \code{TRUE}.
The cohort year of the pinniped.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as the input vectors
}
\description{
Calculate the age of a pinniped based on a given date and cohort year
}
\details{
\code{event.date} (event date) and \code{cohort} must be the same length.

The age of the pinniped is calculated by taking the year of the event date,
subtracting the cohort year, and subtracting an additional 1 if the month of
the event date is less than 10 (before October).
For instance, if the event date is 15 Nov 2010 and the cohort is 2005, the pinniped age is 2010 - 2005 - 0 = 5
If the event date is 15 Feb 2010 and the cohort is 2005, then the pinniped age is 2010 - 2005 - 1 = 4.

If either the event date or the cohort is \code{NA}, then the pinniped age will be \code{NA}

  cohort = c(2010, 2010, 2011)

pinniped_age(x$resight_date, x$cohort)
